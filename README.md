JS Activity!

Work in teams, and have one person share their screen. 
Using the same files we created during the demo:
*Remember we have to open our index.html in browser to see our code running/console

Write code that will print your first and last name to the console. They should be in separate variables initially and then combined before being printed. 
Find the values of the following and log them to the console:
7 + 2
7 - 5
7 * 7
1000 / 5
Write a block of code that will use a variable called ‘lightStatus’.
If the lightStatus = ‘on’ log “The light is on!” to the console.
If the lightStatus = ‘off’ log “The light is off” to the console.
Otherwise, log ‘Please set lightStatus to either on or off’ to the console
